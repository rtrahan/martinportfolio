    "location": "Martha's Vineyard, MA",
    "description": "This barn was designed for a tradesman on Martha's Vineyard who, after recently starting a family, needed a shop space that was both highly functional and beautiful. The intent was to create a workspace that could serve his business while maintaining the flexibility to partially convert into an accessory dwelling unit in the future. This dual-use concept guided many of the early decisions, as natural light, ventilation, and spatial hierarchy had to support both modes of use.\n\nThe building takes its cues from the traditional monitor barn—long a staple of agricultural structures—but adapted the to a contemporary island context. The raised monitor volume introduces light into the center of the plan, while the south-facing side opens into a covered portico, providing shaded outdoor work area and weather protection for material handling.\n\nSite and regulatory constraints dictated that the footprint not exceed 36' x 36'. Working within that boundary, the plan was organized to accommodate both a functional workshop layout and a future living configuration without inflating the envelope. The structure itself reflects this logic as well: the building is stick framed and built on a 6\" slab-on-grade with a thickened edge. The portico is framed using a box-beam design for strength and visual lightness, while the monitor employs a cantilever detail to minimize visible vertical supports and preserve the interior clearance needed for equipment and tool workflows.\n\nTogether, these decisions produced a building that feels grounded in the practical realities of a working tradesman's life—durable, adaptable, flexible, and understated—while still offering the possibility of domesticity and warmth in the years ahead.",

    "location": "Martha's Vineyard, MA",
    "description": "Designed by a post-and-beam framer on Martha's Vineyard, this project pairs a classic New England cape with traditional timber frame construction while incorporating contemporary building systems. Structural insulated panels (SIPs) form the enclosure and provide high thermal performance, energy efficiency, and ease of installation on a coastal site.\n\nSeveral constraints shaped the building's form and organization. Budget and zoning limitations influenced both the footprint and overall height, resulting in a compact two-story building that maintains a time-honored profile. These parameters prompted design decisions to maximize spatial efficiency, including a winding staircase that conserves interior square footage without compromising circulation.\n\nThe post and beam construction dictated specific load paths within the building, requiring careful placement and coordination of bearing elements relative to the layout. The models and documentation produced supported the resolution of these conditions, ensuring compatibility between the timber frame, SIP enclosure, and interior program.\n\nThe result is a house that aligns traditional craft with modern building science—marrying familiar regional character with improved performance, longevity, and constructability.",
